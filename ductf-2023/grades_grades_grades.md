Description: Sign up and see those grades :D! How well did you do this yearâ€™s subject?

Challenge author: donfran

Category: Web (Easy)

Source code: [https://github.com/DownUnderCTF/Challenges\_2023\_Public/tree/main/web/grades-grades-grades](https://github.com/DownUnderCTF/Challenges\_2023\_Public/tree/main/web/grades-grades-grades)

## Basic Recon <a href="#3240" id="3240"></a>

When we first access the challenge, we are first greeted with a home screen with a sign up function.

Upon a successful sign up, we have access to the grades screen.

## Source Code Review <a href="#3355" id="3355"></a>

So now that we have a general idea of how the website functions, lets have a look at the source code.

Here we see a particularly interesting route /grades\_flag which seems to print out the flag, however it seems to only do so if the user is authenticated and is a teacher.

So next we try to find out how the server authenticates the user.

Here we see that when a user is registering, the server will create a JWT to create a session cookie to handle authentication.

So we look deeper into how the JWT is created.

Based on the function, it appears to just take data and encode it into a JWT without sanitizing the data.

## Exploitation <a href="#2341" id="2341"></a>

Now that we know how the server works, lets hop onto BurpSuite to have a look at the HTTP requests.

A normal request to sign up as a student looks like this:

Based on the code, we found out that the server checks whether a user is a teacher through a boolean is\_teacher, so we can try modifying the request to include that.

And it seems to successfully register the user.

Now we try to access the /grades\_flag route (while remembering to change the auth\_token to the one we just got).

And there we have it!
